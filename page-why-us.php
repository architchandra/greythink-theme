We realize that an greythink is a big decision for you and that admissions process involves significant investment of your time, finances and emotional energy. We realize that a demanding professional role, personal commitments and other parts of your “real” life all happen in parallel as you go through this process and we want to ensure we make the application journey enjoyable and “light” for you 

Therefore we want to be a true partner in your journey to a top school and work with you as a truly professional and personal resource — before, during and after you apply to business school. 

Our core values are integrity, candor and responsiveness. Our culture is built on creativity, communication and commitment. When you work with greythink4India, you get more than just our time. Our clients also get full access to an array of proven, proprietary frameworks and tools for optimizing their candidacies. Just as important, you get our passion for your greythink admissions success. And our expertise and support don’t end with admissions. Many greythink students and recent graduates come to back for discussions related to career advancement. We feel privileged to stay connected with them and cherish their friendship 

Those who worked with us have made very interesting transitions in their careers and we feel privileged to being part of this journey 

A 40+ armed forces professional made the transition to one of the hottest tech companies on the planet 
An FMCG professional made the transition to becoming a strategy consultant at top 3 consulting firm 
An NGO professional makes a shift to sought after social VC firm
